## Tools & Libraries
- Python, TensorFlow/Keras
- MNIST dataset
- Streamlit for frontend UI

## Methodology
1. Load and preprocess MNIST data
2. Train CNN model
3. Evaluate model on test data
4. Create interactive web UI with Streamlit

## Results
- Achieved ~98% test accuracy
- Real-time digit prediction with Streamlit

## Conclusion
A simple yet effective project for beginners to understand image classification with deep learning.
